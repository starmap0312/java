// Futures and promises are non-blocking
//   they make use of callbacks instead of typical blocking operations
//   they facilitate callbacks on a higher-level: ex. combinators such as flatMap, foreach, and filter
//     this composes futures in a non-blocking way
// Future:
//   a placeholder object that you create for a result that doesnâ€™t yet complete (exist)
// What is wrong with future and callbacks?
// 1) we may need a dedicated error callback function in case an Exception occurs during processing
// 2) callback hells: it becomes messy once we begin to chain callback functions
//    ex. if one callback triggers another asynchronous function which in turn takes its own callback, and so on
//        (rather common in the JavaScript / Node.js applications) 
// 3) we need to make sure a callback is called multiple times by ourselves 
// 4) if there are several asynchronous tasks in sequence, we may want a callback only when the last task has completed
// Promise/CompletableFuture:
// 1) a sensible mechanism to mitigate callback hell and write clean asynchronous code
//    it replaces callbacks which signal successful or exceptional completion of a function
//    (it must be fulfilled at most once)
// 2) it supports Lambdas (functional), parallelism (all its methods can run asyncrhonously) 
//    it is event driven so we can build systems in a non-blocking fashion
// Two most typical use cases of Promise/CompletableFuture:
//   when you want to collect the result of an asynchronous task or multiple asynchronous tasks
// 1) Parallel computing on multiple CPU cores
// 2) Remote method invocation through e.g. SOA or REST calls through a remote interface
//    it a means to specify what should be done with the output once it is received in a
//      functional, declarative and reactive programming style
